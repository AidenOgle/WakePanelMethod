2D Panel Method
Aiden Ogle, 2025

This project was developed under the guidance of Dr. Dan Quinn during Summer 2025 with the intention of creating a user-friendly 2D Vortex Panel Method program that allows for a wide variety of flow scenarios and body arrangements. MATLAB code that formed the basis of the first version of this project was provided by Tianjun Han.
