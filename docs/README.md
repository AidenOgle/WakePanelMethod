# WakePanelMethod

### Motivation
This project is intended to provide a modular and adaptable application of the 2D Vortex Panel Method for unsteady flow behavior, with specific focus on wake behavior. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an intuitive codebase with documentation for both the code and the underlying theory behind the panel method, such that it has both instructional and potential research applications.

### Credit
This project was developed by Aiden Ogle under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Quinn over the summer of 2025, using original MATLAB code provided by Dr. Tianjun Han. Any questions you may have regarding the project can be addressed to aidenogleofficial@gmail.com. Additionally, I would be more than happy to hear about any interesting ways in which the code is applied, feel free to reach out.
