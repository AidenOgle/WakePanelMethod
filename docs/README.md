# WakePanelMethod

## Motivation
This project is intended to provide a modular and adaptable application of the 2D Vortex Panel Method for unsteady flow behavior, with specific focus on wake behavior. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an intuitive codebase with documentation for both the code and the underlying theory behind the panel method, such that it has both instructional and potential research applications.

## Wiki
The [Wiki](https://github.com/AidenOgle/WakePanelMethod/wiki) provides secondary documentation for the project, covering both techical implementation and theoretical background. It is a good source for going through the derivations of how the vortex panel method is applied, and it is especially useful in providing insight into the methodology of how the panel method is implemented in the code. It is important to note that the wiki is by no means rigourous or exhaustive, and the information presented there should be met with the same academic skepticsism as all unreviewed sources. The main purpose of the wiki is to provide context and explaination to the development of the project, and it is therefore being updated concurrently with the code.

This project was developed by Aiden Ogle under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Quinn over the summer of 2025 at UVA, using original MATLAB code provided by Dr. Tianjun Han. Any questions you may have regarding the project can be addressed to aidenogleofficial@gmail.com. Additionally, I would enjoy hearing about any interesting applications of the code that may be found, so please feel free to reach out.
