## TODO

- [x] doublecheck and fix plot aspect ratio
  - [ ] fix padding issues, ideally dont need to call `ax.set_aspect('equal')` and can just handle it through calculation
- [x] ~~offset of initial wakepoint for vortex blob mechanism~~ Limit vortex blobs to wake votices
- [x] vectorize rollup loops
- [x] vectorization self influence terms
- [ ] vortex core merging
- [ ] rotation and offset point for body geometry definition
  - [ ] define quarterchord point directly, can then be used in moment coeff calculations
- [ ] refactor code into modules
  - [x] body
  - [x] vortexblob
  - [ ] plotting
- [ ] update motion section as function and reqork how positioning is handled
- [x] Make sure kutta condition is being enforced correctly for closed bodies
- [ ] bluff bodies handling, moveable wake separation point, Kutta Condition toggling
- [ ] validate lift against tables
- [ ] Conceptual Additions- make sure theory is being applied correctly. Make clear assumptions, limitations, and abstractions in both the underlying theory being applied and the code implementation
  - [ ] Lift induced Drag
  - [ ] Lift, Drag, Moment, Pressure, associated coeffs
  - [ ] Make sure wake/downwash effects are being included
  - [ ] make sure Kutta-Joukousky Theorem is being applied correctly (component decomposition for angle of attack, geometry of integral discretization)
  - [ ] (potentally) momentum viscous drag modeling
- [ ] plots for coefficients
- [ ] (potentially) toggles for lift models and assumptions
